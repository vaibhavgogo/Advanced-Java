# 📘 Week 1 – Advanced Java Fundamentals

## 🗓️ Duration
**Start Date:** July 23, 2025  
**End Date:** July 27, 2025

## ✅ Topics Covered – Core Concepts of Advanced Java

- **Java Class & Object Basics**
  - Defining classes (`Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`)
  - Object instantiation and reference
  - `.class` file compilation

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
  - Parent-child class relationships
  - Method overriding
  - Dynamic method dispatch

- **Upcasting & Downcasting**
  - Upcasting: Parent reference to child object
  - Downcasting: Explicit casting from parent to child
  - Use case: `Animal a = new Dog();`

- **Typecasting**
  - Primitive and reference type casting
  - Runtime type checks: `instanceof` keyword

- **Conditional Statements**
  - `if`, `else if`, `else` constructs
  - Nested conditions

- **Loops**
  - `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops
  - Iteration and flow control

- **Error Handling**
  - Syntax-level error testing
  - Debugging invalid inputs or logic errors

- **Java Program Structure**
  - `public static void main(String[] args)`
  - Compilation and execution flow

🔍 Learning Goals
Understand how Java executes programs via JVM

Practice object-oriented principles: class, object, inheritance

Learn how casting works in Java (upcasting and downcasting)

Apply conditional logic and loops

Write modular and clean code


## 📌 Summary

Week 1 of Advanced Java focused on revisiting and strengthening object-oriented fundamentals. Key areas included class hierarchies, typecasting, program structure, and control flow, setting the stage for more advanced topics like JDBC, multithreading, and servlet programming.
